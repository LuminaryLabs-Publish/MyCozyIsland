# My Cozy Island Agent Start

**Repository:** `LuminaryLabs-Publish/MyCozyIsland`

**Last aligned:** `2026-07-09T02-31-41-04-00`

## Purpose

This `.agent/` folder is the repo-local operating memory for scheduled and manual breakdown work on `MyCozyIsland`.

Read this folder before changing implementation code.

## Current selection result

The accessible `LuminaryLabs-Publish` organization repo list was compared against the tracked/documented repo ledger in `LuminaryLabs-Dev/LuminaryLabs` and sampled root `.agent/START_HERE.md` state.

No checked non-Cavalry Publish repo was fully new, central-ledger absent, undocumented, recently added but undocumented, or missing sampled root `.agent/START_HERE.md` state.

`LuminaryLabs-Publish/TheCavalryOfRome` remains excluded by standing rule.

`MyCozyIsland` was selected as the oldest eligible sampled fallback for this pass. The repo is visually stable, but the next source cut still needs a narrower proof gate around the existing cloud/grass/rail consumers: route token readback, deterministic descriptor summaries, host projection, and browser-consumer fixture rows must exist before any visual rewrite or shared-kit promotion.

## Current product read

`MyCozyIsland` is a standalone static Three.js cozy island route. It vendors the domain kits it needs under `src/kits/` and runs from `index.html` without depending on a remote experiment repo at runtime.

The active route is:

```txt
index.html
  -> canvas#game
  -> #cloud-loader
  -> #error
  -> ./src/main-cloudform.js?v=hero-cloud-4
  -> Three.js CDN
  -> local source-domain descriptor kits
  -> inline renderer, input, movement, camera, smoke, flame, cloud drift, and legacy host diagnostics
```

## Current interaction loop

```txt
static browser route
  -> load src/main-cloudform.js?v=hero-cloud-4
  -> import Three.js CDN and local source-domain kits
  -> construct island, ocean floor, foliage, clearing, fire, smoke, grass, wind, cloud, and hero-cloud descriptors
  -> create Three.js renderer, scene, camera, lights, fog, water, terrain, floor, foam, path, foliage, fence, campfire, smoke, grass, and point-cloud clouds
  -> install resize, keyboard, wheel, pointerdown, pointerup, and pointermove handlers
  -> wheel mutates scroll progress directly
  -> rail() samples the sky-to-eye camera curve while progress < 0.985
  -> pointer mutates yaw before first-person and yaw/pitch after first-person
  -> keyboard movement unlocks at progress >= 0.985
  -> valid(next) accepts or rejects movement by clearing boundary and campfire keepout only
  -> frame updates sea bob, first-person movement or rail camera, smoke, flame, cloud drift, and renderer
  -> globalThis.CozyIsland exposes cloudContract, cloudPointCache, and getScrollProgress
```

## Target proof loop

```txt
RouteTokenReadback
  -> SourceProfile
  -> SourceFingerprint
  -> SceneSourceSnapshot
  -> BrowserInputActionFrame
  -> ActionResult
  -> MovementPolicyResult
  -> CameraRailSnapshot
  -> GrassPlacementSnapshot
  -> GrassInstanceSnapshot
  -> HeroCloudDescriptorSnapshot
  -> HeroCloudCacheSnapshot
  -> CloudDriftResult
  -> RenderHostSnapshot
  -> CozyIslandHost.getState()
  -> DOM-free browser consumer fixture rows
  -> central ledger sync
```

## Main rule

Preserve `index.html`, `./src/main-cloudform.js?v=hero-cloud-4`, the current visible scene, the legacy `globalThis.CozyIsland` surface, the input thresholds, the clearing/campfire movement constraints, and the current cloud look.

Add fixture-readable proof records and an additive `globalThis.CozyIslandHost.getState()` before any visual rewrite, renderer extraction, or shared-kit promotion.

MyCozyIsland Browser Consumer Proof Split + Cloud/Grass Readback Fixture Gate
